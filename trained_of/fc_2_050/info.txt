newest save system (contains epoch, epsilon, model state dict, optimiser state dict, loss)
started at epsilon 1.0
agent will add reward to previous result when forced to skip turn

played against fc at epsilon 0.5

66 input
256 hidden states
8 output
3 linears with relu

around 80-90% winrate against random bot (highest peak at 95%)
around 50-60% winrate against fc at epsilon 0.0 (noticed some very high disparities, meaning sometimes it will win 15:1, but lose the same way otherwise)

when played against me:
similar to fc, it cycles through a specific order every game (different every game), I was able to predict its cycle, and absolutely destroy the bot.
I was confidently winning because it was repeatedly using riposte, parry, thrust, fleche, lunge cycle. I was able to counter it every single time.
However, at 14 points that I've won absolutely smashing the bot, it changed up the order??? I was a bit shocked because it was actually able to learn mid game.
