newest save system (contains epoch, epsilon, model state dict, optimiser state dict, loss)
started at epsilon 1.0
agent will add reward to previous result when forced to skip turn

played against fc at epsilon 0.5

66 input
256 hidden states
8 output
3 linears with relu

around 80-90% winrate against random bot (highest peak at 90%)
around 60-70% winrate against fc at epsilon 0.0 (noticed some very high disparities, meaning sometimes it will win 15:1, but lose the same way otherwise)
