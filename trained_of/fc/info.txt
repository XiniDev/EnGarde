around 80-90% winrate against random bot

when played against me:
it cycles through a specific order every game (though order is different every game), but it abuses this particular order every game probably based on their hand?
this makes sense because in if against a random bot, given their current hand, it will choose the most optimal cycle order of moves to beat the random bot.

probably due to overfitting?
