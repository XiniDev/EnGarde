newest save system (contains epoch, epsilon, model state dict, optimiser state dict, loss)
started at epsilon 1.0
agent will add reward to previous result when forced to skip turn

trained against both agent 1 and agent 2 in fc self play
at 040 epsilon for agent 1 + 2

66 input
256 hidden states
8 output
3 linears with relu

around 80% winrate against random bot (for epo50)
somehow super fast speed for 050 might need retrain to see
