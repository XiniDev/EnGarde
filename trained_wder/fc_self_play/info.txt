g0x0 means gamma = 0.x0

gamma 0.9 = 0.5 importance on 6 steps
gamma 0.8 = 0.5 importance on 3 steps
gamma 0.7 = 0.5 importance on 2 steps
gamma 0.6 = 0.5 importance on 1 step

0.7 seems to destroy both 0.9 and 0.8 (do more further testing and generate report) (0.95 winrate or more)

0.8 seems to do okay against 0.9

maybe can conclude lower gamma values are better for this game?
